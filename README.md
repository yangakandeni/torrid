This is a blog app that creates a space for users to ask questions, answer questions and write articles about topics they are passionate about.

## Description

TORRID is a social media platform that creates a space for people to share ideas around topics they are TORRID about. This platform is a sanctuary for asking thought provoking *_questions_*, providing reverting *_answers_* and writing insightful articles on a variety of topics.

## Motivation

As an active subscriber on two of the most popular blog oriented social media platforms, Quora [www.quora.com] and Medium [www.medium.com], I am sometimes frustrated by having to switch between the two sometimes. An example, you've just read an interesting article on @medium and you would like to ask a question related to this topic to the platform's community, you can't! except if you post something on the comments or ask the author directly.

Now, you are on @quora, a community member has asked an interesting question and the answers end on a cliff-hanger. In order to get an indepth article on this particular topic, you'd have to switch over to @medium.

The motivation for torrid, is to create a space that will facilitate, *asking questions*, *providing answers* and *reading / writing articles*.

## Objective

To develop a community driven social media platform that will facilitate asking questions, providing answers, reading and writing articles on a variety of topics. The main goal is to avail knowledge in abundance.
